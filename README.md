##INPUT
>
The programs feeds from files on working directory and some subdirectories. This files are supplied but they are not included as necesary for the project . Every files should be stored in the working directory when the program runs

>Working Directory contains:
	- Features.txt		List of all features.Used for setting column names
	- Features_info.txt 	Describes all features. Useful for knowing variables but not for computing
	- Activity_labels.txt	Contains Description of indexed activities from y_train.txt and y_test.txt 							files
	* Train is a subdirector withy Training data
		Contains:
			y_train.txt    		- Training labels.
			x_train.txt		- Contains common Features for working
			subject_train.txt	- Contains Subject Data.  Each row identifies the subject who performed the 							activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
	* Test is a subdirector with Test data
		Contains
			y_test.txt		- Test labels.
			x_test.txt		- Contains common Features for working
			subject_test.txt	- Contains Subject Data.  Each row identifies the subject who performed the 				activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
>Other files contained on the directory are not used by the program
	

##OUTPUT
1. Output is a file in txt format called "tidyDataSet.txt"
2. Old file will be deleted and a new file with the same name will be created when the program run
3. Contains 81 columns:
	- First is index name 
	- Second is Subject id
	- Rest of columns are variables selected from those variables wiht mean or std in original 					files
	- Those cols are computed by the program
4. Columns Contains headers
5. Separator is a \t character. It is easy to read.


##PROCESS
>###Notes:
1. There are several functiomns define in order to structure the code.
2. Variables use camecase an are descriptive.
3. There is a lot of comments. 
4. A Automatict test has been included for let checking results. Output is the file of course, but a View of that file too, with appropiate names
5. It produces a Tidy data set in the short form.

>###Algorithm
1. Read The features.txt file for obtaining the var names so it will be col names-
2. Read the data from training set (train directory), and set its appropiate column names, including an ActivityIndex and Subject Column Name
3. Read the data from test set (test directory), and set  its appropiate column names, including an ActivityIndex and Subject Column Name
4. Training and test has the same format, and column position, so it is posible to merge all rows from both sets
	So a new dataframe is created
	## TrainDataFrame dim is 7352 rows * 561 cols
	## TestDataFrame dim is  2947 rows * 561 cols
	##                      ------
	## Combined is          10299 rows
	##
5. Extract only columns with mean Value and std standard deviation.
	## The question is meanFreq() is a mean()?. Info says
	## meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency 
	##
	## The mean is the average of the numbers: a calculated "central" value of a set of numbers. 
	## meanFreq is not strictly a mean because is weighted, but it is an average, SO I WILL CONSIDER IT
6. Joinn activity Index and activity names
7. Make Up Inital columns.Used columns came from the features, but some variables had some errors like a Double Body. It have been fixed
8. Aggregate filter data set by ActivityName and Subject and compute a mean of every groups. So we get a new set
9. Change Tidy Data Frame Column Names by more appropiate Name. Criteria are
	* Time as Time Domain Still Remains at the begining of the variable name
	* Fourier as FFT (Frecuency Domain) Still Remains at the begining of the variable name
	* Every "-" character have on original variable names have been removed
	* Every "(" and ")" characteres have on original variable names have been removed
	* Camel case has been implemented
	* Units in every variable remains the same from the raw data
10. Write the tidy data set as a new file tidyDataSet.txt
11. Reads the file and present a table on screen with the overall result set
